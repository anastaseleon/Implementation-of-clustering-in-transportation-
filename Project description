# Driver Behavior Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to segment drivers based on their driving behavior. The behavior is characterized by several features such as the number of trips per day, distance driven per day, average speed, hours driven, and stop area. Clustering is performed using the K-means algorithm. 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
You'll need to install the following libraries before running the code:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DriverBehaviorClustering.git`
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Description
The project starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying data and its distributions. 

Then, the project proceeds with K-means clustering implementation. We aim to have a reasonable number of clusters while minimizing distortion. We also attempt to achieve a high silhouette score and a high Calinski-Harabasz score, although we anticipate some overlap of clusters due to the nature of driver behaviors.

The data is also processed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps visualize high-dimensional data, highlight relationships between variables, and make the data more tractable for machine learning algorithms.

## Files
1. `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
2. `KmeansClustering.ipynb`: K-means Clustering
3. `PCA.ipynb`: Principal Component Analysis
4. `data/summary_trips.csv`: The raw data
5. `requirements.txt`: Required packages for the project.

## Results
Based on our analysis, we found that a 6-cluster solution provides the best balance between the three metrics (distortion, silhouette score, and Calinski-Harabasz score).
